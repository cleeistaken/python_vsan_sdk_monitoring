      This is a catch all state when none of the other states apply. An object with this state is not compliant with its current policy, but is meeting the availablity (NumberOfFailuresToTolerate) policy. The object might be in this state because vSAN is not able to meet a non-availability related policy such as NumberOfDiskStripesPerObject because of lack of available resources. User need check the vSAN system resources like the number of fault domains and hosts, free capacity to make it compliant.

      The object is not compliant with its current policy, but is meeting the availablity (NumberOfFailuresToTolerate) policy. However, the object rebuild is paused because of lack of available resources.

      Object policy was recently changed and has not yet been applied. The object is still fully compliant with the new availability policy, but not compliant the new non-availability related policies. Note it's a transient status and will either transit to 'healthy' or 'nonavailabilityrelatedincompliancewithpolicypendingfailed' status eventually depending on if the new policy can be accepted or not due to resource limitation. And depending on how much transient capacity is being used in the cluster, the object will stay in the status from minutes to hours. No user action needed for this status.

      Object policy was recently changed but failed to apply to the object because of lacking of resource. The object is still fully compliant with the new availability policy. User need add more resource to the cluster so that vSAN can re-apply the new non-availability related policy to the object automatically to make it fully compliant.
